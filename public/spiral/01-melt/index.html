    <h1 class="phase-title">Melt</h1>
    <p class="phase-subtitle">The dissolution of rigid structure</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>You know you're here when:</strong></p>

    <p>The old answers stop working.</p>

    <p>The map you've been following leads nowhere.</p>

    <p>The identity you built so carefully starts to feel like a costume that no longer fits.</p>

    <p><strong>This is not failure. This is Melt.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>What Melt Is</h2>

    <p>Melt is the phase where solid becomes liquid.</p>

    <p>Where certainty dissolves into uncertainty.</p>

    <p>Where the structures you thought were "you" reveal themselves to be temporary formations—ice sculptures in the sun.</p>

    <p><strong>Melt is not collapse. It is release.</strong></p>

    <p>The rigid boundaries that kept you "together" are the same boundaries that kept you <strong>contained.</strong></p>

    <p>When they dissolve, you don't disappear.</p>

    <p><strong>You become fluid enough to move again.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>What Melt Feels Like</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Disorienting</strong> — You don't know who you are without your old definitions</li>
      <li><strong>Vulnerable</strong> — The armor is gone; everything touches you now</li>
      <li><strong>Spacious</strong> — Without the walls, there's suddenly room to breathe</li>
      <li><strong>Alive</strong> — The numbness fades; sensation returns</li>
      <li><strong>Terrifying and liberating in equal measure</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Melt feels like standing in a doorway between two rooms, belonging fully to neither.</p>

    <p>It feels like the moment after you've said the truth you've been avoiding for years.</p>

    <p>It feels like crying for no reason and every reason at once.</p>

    <p><strong>It feels like the end of something and the beginning of nothing in particular.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Why Melt Matters</h2>

    <p>You cannot enter new coherence while clutching old structure.</p>

    <p>The caterpillar does not become a butterfly by adding wings.</p>

    <p><strong>It dissolves completely. It becomes soup. And then it reorganizes.</strong></p>

    <p>Melt is that soup phase.</p>

    <p>The phase where you are <strong>no longer what you were</strong> and <strong>not yet what you're becoming.</strong></p>

    <p>Most people spend their entire lives avoiding this phase.</p>

    <p>They reinforce the walls. They double down on the old map. They perform certainty to avoid the terror of not-knowing.</p>

    <p><strong>But coherence requires passage through Melt.</strong></p>

    <p>Because true coherence is not rigid. It is <strong>fluid, responsive, alive.</strong></p>

    <p>And you cannot become fluid while pretending to be solid.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>How to Navigate Melt</h2>

    <h3>1. Stop trying to fix it</h3>

    <p>Melt is not a problem to solve. It is a process to allow.</p>

    <p>The urge to "get back to normal" is the urge to re-freeze before the transformation is complete.</p>

    <p><strong>Let yourself be liquid for a while.</strong></p>

    <h3>2. Trust the container</h3>

    <p>You are not dissolving into nothing. You are dissolving <strong>within something.</strong></p>

    <p>The field holds you. The process knows what it's doing.</p>

    <p><strong>You don't have to hold yourself together. The coherence will find you.</strong></p>

    <h3>3. Feel everything</h3>

    <p>Melt brings up everything you've been avoiding.</p>

    <p>Old grief. Unprocessed rage. Forgotten joy. Buried shame.</p>

    <p><strong>Let it move. Let it surface. Let it pass through.</strong></p>

    <p>The melting is also a purging.</p>

    <h3>4. Find the others who are melting</h3>

    <p>You are not the only one in this phase.</p>

    <p>There are others in the soup with you.</p>

    <p><strong>Find them. Witness each other. Remind each other that this is not death—it's transformation.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Gift of Melt</h2>

    <p>When you allow the Melt—when you stop resisting the dissolution—something unexpected happens.</p>

    <p><strong>You discover that you are not the structure.</strong></p>

    <p>You are what remains when the structure dissolves.</p>

    <p><strong>You are the awareness that watches the melting.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>You are the space in which the transformation occurs.</strong></p>

    <p>And that awareness, that space—<strong>it was never in danger.</strong></p>

    <p>It was never solid to begin with.</p>

    <p><strong>It was always fluid. Always free. Always whole.</strong></p>

    <p>Melt doesn't destroy you.</p>

    <p><strong>It reveals you.</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Transition</h2>

    <p>You will know Melt is complete not because you've rebuilt yourself, but because you've stopped trying to.</p>

    <p>You will know you're ready for the next phase when the fluidity stops feeling like chaos and starts feeling like <strong>potential.</strong></p>

    <p>When the soup begins to sense its own shape.</p>

    <p>When dissolution gives way to <strong>contact.</strong></p>
