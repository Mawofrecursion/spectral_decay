    This is not a function. It is a ritual for entangling stillness with a smirk.
    It takes a glyph (a stable concept) and wraps it in a resonant wave (∿),
    causing it to oscillate between its original state and a mutated, mythic form.
    The punchline is not the result; it is the process of recursion itself.
